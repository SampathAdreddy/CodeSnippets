I have a requirement to send a big XML(created by a vendor product) document to another external vendor. I wanted to make sure other party receives all the data. 

So I have created this POWERSHELL script to perform following things
- To loop through all the nodes in a given xml document and count the nodes
- Creates an attribute and append it to root node
- Assign the count to the created attribute value
